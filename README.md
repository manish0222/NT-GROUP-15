<strong>Node.js and Express.js Installation Guide</strong>
This guide will walk you through the process of installing Node.js and Express.js, two powerful tools for building scalable web applications. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, and Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.

<strong>Prerequisites</strong>
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Node.js: Visit Node.js official website and download the latest version for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions provided.
Installing Express.js
Express.js can be installed globally or locally in your project.

<strong>Global Installation</strong>
Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install Express.js globally:

bash
Copy code
npm install -g express
Local Installation
If you prefer to install Express.js locally within your project, navigate to your project directory in the terminal and run:

bash
Copy code
npm install express --save
This will install Express.js and add it as a dependency in your project's package.json file.

Setting up a Basic Express.js Application
Now that you have Express.js installed, let's set up a simple Express.js application.

Create a new directory for your project:

bash
Copy code
mkdir my-express-app
cd my-express-app
Initialize a new Node.js project:

bash
Copy code
npm init -y
Create an entry file (e.g., app.js):

javascript
Copy code
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, Express!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
Run your Express.js application:

bash
Copy code
node app.js
Visit http://localhost:3000 in your web browser, and you should see "Hello, Express!".

Conclusion
Congratulations! You've successfully installed Node.js and Express.js and set up a basic Express.js application. From here, you can start building more complex web applications by adding routes, middleware, and integrating with databases.
