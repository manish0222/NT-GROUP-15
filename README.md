# Northern Trust Hackathon Group 15

## Project Overview CurrencyTracker Insights
Introduction
Welcome to CurrencyTracker Insights, a cutting-edge project developed for the Northern Trust Hackathon. This ambitious undertaking combines the power of the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack for frontend and backend development with Python for robust data processing, utilizing libraries such as Pandas. The focus of this project is to provide graphical visualizations of currency tracking, specifically in relation to the US Dollar, spanning the years 2012 to 2022.

Project Vision
CurrencyTracker Insights aims to offer a comprehensive view of currency fluctuations, providing users with valuable insights into historical trends and patterns. By integrating the MERN stack with Python's Pandas library, we seek to create an interactive and user-friendly platform that not only presents data visually but also enables users to analyze and interpret currency movements over the past decade.

##Key Objectives
-1. MERN Stack Development
Frontend (React.js).
  The frontend, developed using React.js, ensures a responsive and intuitive user interface. Users will navigate seamlessly through historical currency data, accessing a range of visualization tools for a comprehensive understanding of currency performance.
  Backend (Node.js and Express.js)
Node.js and Express.js form the core of our backend infrastructure, providing a robust foundation for data management and retrieval. This ensures efficient communication between the frontend and the database, allowing for real-time updates and seamless user interactions.

Database (MongoDB)
MongoDB, a NoSQL database, is employed for efficient storage and retrieval of historical currency data. Its flexibility enables us to handle diverse data types and support the dynamic nature of CurrencyTracker Insights.

-2. Python Data Processing
Python, with the Pandas library, serves as the engine for data processing. By analyzing currency data spanning a decade, we can extract valuable insights, identify trends, and generate meaningful visualizations that empower users to make informed decisions.

-3. Graphical Visualization
The project's core feature is the graphical visualization of currency tracking. Utilizing interactive charts, graphs, and maps, users can explore and analyze the performance of various currencies against the US Dollar, gaining a deeper understanding of economic trends and factors influencing currency values.

CurrencyTracker Insights aspires to be a valuable resource for financial analysts, economists, and anyone interested in gaining insights into the dynamic world of currency movements. Through the seamless integration of technology and data visualization, our project aims to provide a unique and insightful experience for users navigating the complex landscape of currency tracking.
